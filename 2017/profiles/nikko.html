  <h3 class="section-heading px-3 py-1">Favorite Project</h3>
  <div class="px-3 mb-2">
  I really enjoyed working on the POC Crash Analytics Dashboard. I was fortunate enough to receive this project on the first day of my internship and was able to hit the ground running. Less than two weeks later I had built a fully functioning dashboard that displayed crash data received from network requests to API endpoints built by another intern. This was a very fulfilling project and I learned a lot in building it.  </div>

  <h3 class="section-heading px-3 py-1">Biggest Takeaway</h3>
  <div class="info px-3 mb-2">
    My biggest takeaway thus far has been the importance of team-work in software development. I've been given the opportunity to work with an amazing team during this internship and have had my eyes open to what exactly a cohesive, synchronized team can accomplish.

  <h3 class="section-heading px-3 py-1">Favorite Internship Memory</h3>
  <div class="info px-3 mb-2">
  There were a lot of really good memories during this internship, most of them revolving around spending time with the team. Whether it working on an engineering-related problem with a few team members, having lunch together, playing ping-pong or our off-site hike in Half Moon Bay. I really enjoyed spending time with the team and it is hard for me to pick a favorite moment.  </div>
