  <h3 class="section-heading px-3 py-1">Favorite Project</h3>
  <div class="px-3 mb-2">
During my time being a Rakuten Intern, I worked on two projects. My favourite project is Crash Reporting App for various reason. First, I didn’t like Javascript first time around when I tried to learn it myself year ago. But working on this project made me fall in love with Javascript specifically Node.js. Second, I was extremely lucky enough to get the opportunity to learn how real projects are designed and developed starting from POC. It also gave me better understanding of the business side perspective and big picture of all moving parts. Working on this project, I have also developed excellent communication and relationship building skills. I am thankful to the team for letting me work and believing Interns in major projects. Team have been extremely helpful and have offered me ongoing support throughout my internship. It has been a wonderful experience for me and I thoroughly enjoyed working with the team.   </div>

  <div class="info px-3 mb-2">
Working as summer intern at Rakuten, taught me so many things that went far beyond the theoretical knowledge I gained in university. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to gain many new skills that will help me in my future endeavours.

My favourite internship memory is our Summer off-site hiking trip to Purisima Creek Redwoods at Half Moon Bay. It was definitely team fun and gave me opportunity to bond with other team members.
